# NU-Homework-4


Hello!

    This is my README file for my quiz project. I tried to make this project as dynamic as I could without adding text to the question section or the answer button sections. This would allow both of those sections to be updated through Javascript. I used some fun/nerdy questions to take away from the everyday coding life that we are now use to, just to personalize it a bit. I also used a separate page for the questions to organize my set up a bit more. I also added a timer.js file which isnt part of my project but to try and understand the logic that Nick was trying to use for the timer function in class. Unfortunately I didnt have enough time to finish the project during the alloted time throughout the week seeing as my frustrations got the best of me. This project is incomplete but I will update it soon and have it up to spec! 

    Thank you, 
    Ray H.
